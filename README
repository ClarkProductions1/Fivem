peds.meta  MAKE sure you rename the file peds.meta if you are using either the male or female ped.

Below you will see and example of how to change the name of the ped in the peds.meta to match what the ped is named so you can spwan it in game.

Original Code  <Name>male_example_model_name_01</Name>
Edit the male_example_model_name_01 to what the name of the ped is.  EXAMPLE:(original format)> <Name>male_example_model_name_01</Name> New PED NAME ==>>>>> <Name>MY PED NAME HERE</Name>
this will be the same for the female ped. If you have any questions or need any help please feel free to reach out to me on discord my user name is
